# Projects
These are projects I developed as a part of [Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/drive).

## Environment Setup
Make sure you have Anaconda installed. Then, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install all necessary pacakges needed for all my projects.

If you have issues installing packages, want to set up using Docker, or want to set up tensorflow with GPU enabled, follow the instructions provided by Udacity [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit).
